Welcome to the **AdventureWorks 2016 Extended ReSeller Sales Analysis** repository ‚Äî a comprehensive showcase of enterprise data integration, historical trend analysis, and boardroom-ready insights built using **Microsoft Fabric** and **Power BI**.

---

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates:

- How to **ingest enterprise data** from SQL Server (on-prem) into **MS Fabric Lakehouse**.  
- Performing **historical analysis** spanning 10 years (2005‚Äì2014) on ReSeller transactions.  
- Deriving actionable **business insights** from measures like **Avg Sales, Discounts, Gross Margins, Units Sold**, and more.  
- Crafting **Power BI dashboards** suitable for **investors, executives, and recruiters**, highlighting both **technical and commercial skills**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Microsoft Fabric** | Enterprise data lakehouse, pipelines, and data transformation |
| **SQL Server + SSMS** | On-prem source database hosting AdventureWorks `.bak` file |
| **Power BI Gateway** | Secure connectivity from on-prem SQL Server to Fabric Lakehouse |
| **Power BI** | Interactive dashboards and visualizations |
| **Python / Pandas / Matplotlib** | Exploratory data analysis (optional) |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Why Microsoft Fabric?

**Microsoft Fabric** was chosen as the platform for this analysis because it provides:

- **Enterprise-scale data management**: Lakehouse architecture supports large transactional datasets like AdventureWorks.  
- **Seamless integration**: Connects easily with on-prem SQL Server via **Power BI Gateway**.  
- **Advanced analytics pipelines**: Enables historical and scenario-based analysis with minimal infrastructure setup.  
- **Centralized governance & security**: Ideal for enterprise reporting and sharing insights with stakeholders.  
- **Power BI synergy**: Dashboards, visualizations, and storytelling are fully integrated with Fabric datasets.

## üìä Key Insights & Takeaways

1. **Revenue Growth Conceals Margin Erosion Risks**
Both channels experienced top-line growth; however, underlying margin deterioration was driven by different pricing failures rather than discounting.
2. **Reseller Sales Margin Erosion Caused by Runaway Average Unit Price Reductions**
In Reseller Sales, aggressive cuts to average unit prices aimed at boosting volume backfired, leading to disastrous margin outcomes despite higher sales volumes.
3. **Internet Sales Margin Stagnation Due to Unchecked Price Drops Without Elasticity Analysis**
Internet Sales decision-makers frequently lowered prices as soon as cost conditions improved, but without considering price elasticity or demand sensitivity, resulting in minimal margin improvement.
4. **Strong Governance and Regulatory Oversight Are Essential**
Embedding disciplined governance frameworks and regulatory checks is critical to enforce pricing strategies that balance growth ambitions with sustainable profitability and ethical standards across both sales channels.
5. **High-level Highlights**
- Reseller Sales: Experienced volume growth driven by product diversification but suffered margin collapse from poorly managed price reductions.
- Internet Sales: Showed stable revenue growth and broader customer reach supported by digital analytics, but margins remained under pressure due to reactive pricing decisions.
6. **Key Lowlights**
- Reseller Sales: Margin volatility and erosion caused by inconsistent pricing governance and unsustainable price drops.
- Internet Sales: Margin compression from rapid price reductions untempered by demand elasticity studies, eroding profitability.
7. **Fabric + Power BI Enable Comprehensive, Actionable Insights**
The integration transforms complex transactional data into strategic intelligence that highlights not only volume and revenue trends but reveals margin risks and governance gaps, driving balanced commercial decision-making.
8. **Ethical, Data-Backed Strategy Supports Sustainable Growth**
Actionable insights encourage aligning sales growth with strong ethical standards and robust governance, ensuring long-term value creation and risk management across reseller and internet sales ecosystems.

## üíª How It Was Built

1. **Data Preparation**: Restore AdventureWorks `.bak` file into SQL Server (Docker recommended).  
2. **Integration**: Use Power BI Gateway to connect on-prem SQL Server to Fabric Lakehouse.  
3. **Data Pipeline**: Import selected tables (Reseller Sales, Product, Date, Customer).  
4. **Analysis & Visualization**: Build **Power BI dashboards** covering sales, units, margins, and discounts.  
5. **Scenario & Trend Analysis**: Compare **actual vs. no-discount scenarios** to derive strategic insights.
