## 🔑 Key Business Insights  

- **Margin Erosion Drivers Vary by Channel**  
   - *Reseller Sales* suffered disastrous margin declines primarily due to runaway reductions in average unit prices aimed at volume growth.  
   - *Internet Sales* margins stagnated as prices were lowered reactively with favorable costs but without studying demand elasticity, resulting in minimal margin improvement.  

- **Growth vs. Profitability Trade-off Risks**  
   Short-term spikes in sales revenue masked serious erosion in profitability, underscoring risks in pursuing volume growth without disciplined pricing and governance.  

- **⚖️ Strong Governance & Ethical Oversight Required**  
   Embedding governance frameworks and pricing controls is essential to balance aggressive growth ambitions with sustainable profitability and long-term stakeholder value.  

- **📊 Fabric + Power BI Drive Data-Backed Decision Making**  
   The integrated platform converts transactional data into actionable insights, enabling strategic pricing management, margin risk identification, and ethical sales practices across sales channels.
