## üîí Security and Best Practices  

- Store sensitive credentials securely (environment variables or secret managers).  
- Do not commit any passwords, keys, or personal data to the repository.  
- Regularly update software to latest stable versions for security and feature improvements.  
- Use version control branches for development and testing to protect main branch stability.
