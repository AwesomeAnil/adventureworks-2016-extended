# 🧭 AdventureWorks Sales — Full Analysis Flow  
*A backward-looking investigation of Reseller and Internet channel performance, governance, and systemic risk.*

---

## 📘 1 · Purpose & Scope
This document details the full analytical workflow used to evaluate:  
- **Reseller Sales (2005–2014)** and **Internet Sales (2010–2014)** performance trends.  
- Concentration risks, channel resilience, and systemic vulnerabilities.  
- Governance, ethics, and pricing considerations in commercial decisions.  

The goal is interpretive — to provide **actionable insights and strategic recommendations**, not predictive modeling.

## 🧱 2 · Environment & Platform
Developed on **Microsoft Fabric (trial capacity)** using:

| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **SQL Server** | local environment to restore AdventureWorks.bak to SQL Server table |
| **OneLake** | Centralized repository for raw & processed sales data |
| **Delta Lake** | ACID-compliant storage for consistent tables |
| **Fabric Notebooks** | Interactive environment for EDA, analytics, and scenario modeling |
| **Data Pipelines** | Automated ingestion + transformation for reproducibility |
| **Power BI** | for building semantic models and reporting |

Local reproducibility is supported via `sample_data/`.

---

## 🧹 3 · Data Preparation & Quality Checks
1. **Ingest** dimension and fact tables tables from Fabric OneLake to Power BI Desktop.  
2. **Validate columns:** `ResellerID`, `CustomerID`, `SalesAmount`, `UnitsSold`, `Year` on Power BI Desktop.  
3. **Filter:** remove duplicates, missing IDs, or zero/negative sales.  
4. **Derive metrics:** unique reseller/customer counts, volume growth, average sales per partner/customer.  
5. **Build semantic model:** Build semantic model and reports on Power BI and publish to AdventureWorks Fabric workspace trial capacity .  

**Business rationale:** ensures **clean, auditable inputs** and **reliable concentration and growth metrics**.

---

## 📊 4 · Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Actions**
- Compute yearly sales trends, average sales per reseller/customer, and total volumes.  
- Visualize unique resellers/customers by year, and sales growth by channel.  

**Visual placeholders**

- ![Unique Reseller & Customer Growth](/images/unique_counts.png)

**Findings**
- Reseller growth is **volume-driven**; total unique resellers flat (2005–2014).  
- Internet channel shows **increasing unique customers** (2010–2014).  
- Reseller concentration poses **systemic risk**; Internet channel provides resilience.

## 📈 5 · Advanced Analytics & Insights

**Reseller Channel**
- **Volume Concentration:** Existing resellers account for most growth.  
- **Risk:** Single large reseller failure could disrupt the market.  
- **Recommendation:** Diversify reseller base.

**Internet Channel**
- **Customer Growth:** New unique customers increase year-over-year.  
- **Resilience:** Channel can absorb shocks and scale sustainably.

**Governance & Ethics**
- ⚖️ Structured approvals for discounts & pricing changes.  
- 💡 Incentives aligned with sustainable growth, not just short-term volume.  
- 📊 Transparent reporting and audit trails for pricing & promotions.

## ⚖️ 6 · Risk Assessment
| Risk Type | Observation | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Reseller Concentration | Flat unique reseller count | High systemic & geographic risk |
| Lack of Diversification | No new resellers onboarded | Vulnerability to partner collapse |
| Internet Resilience | Growing unique customers | Lower risk, scalable growth |
| Pricing & Discount Risk | Blanket discounts without review | Margin erosion, partner conflict |

**Scenario Analysis**
- Model revenue shocks from a top reseller failure.  
- Compare Reseller vs Internet channel absorption capacity.

---

## 🧩 7 · Strategic Recommendations
- **Diversify Reseller Base:** Reduce dependency on a few partners.  
- **Leverage Internet Growth:** Scale revenue with resilient customer base.  
- **Embed Governance:** Structured approvals, audit trails, incentive alignment.  
- **Monitor Risk:** Regular concentration checks and board reporting.
