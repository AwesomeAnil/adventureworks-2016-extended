## PART A — RESELLER SALES (Channel: B2B)

### 🌟 Highlights — Operational Strengths (Reseller)
| 🟢 Area | Evidence | Why it matters |
|---:|:---|:---|
| Volume baseline | Avg units/txn ~3.5 across period. | Predictable demand anchor for forecasts.
| Cost stability | Avg product cost narrow variance (~±1%). | Procurement discipline gives room to protect margins. 
| Core-territory resilience | North America: consistent sales–margin balance. | Primary cash-flow engine; should be protected. 

---

### ⚠️ Lowlights — Structural Risks (Reseller)
| 🔴 Risk | Data signal | Business implication |
|---:|:---|:---|
| Systemic AUP de-rating | Avg Unit Price fell materially (2010–2012). | Pricing-policy failure — blanket price cuts, not targeted margin management.
| Margin compression hidden by volumes | Gross margins down ~12 points post-2010 while volume remained. | Revenue optics mask profitability erosion. 
| Data-lineage gaps | Missing early discount/freight logging in some tables. | Audit / regulatory exposure: lineage must be certifiable. 

---

### 🧠 Deep-Dive — Reseller Risk Zones
#### A. Pricing Governance Failure (primary root cause)
- What happened: a blanket reduction in base unit prices across SKUs starting ~2010; volume didn’t increase enough to offset margin loss. The drop precedes major discount entries — i.e., discounts were *reactionary*, not causal. 
- Why it matters: Systemic list-price changes without elasticity modeling destroy recoverable margin; discretionary discounts later amplified damage.  
- Immediate war-room actions:
  1. Restrict system-wide price changes — require territory + CPO sign-off.
  2. Implement a Fabric-based **AUP Index** (rolling % change; alert if > ±2% w/o approvals).

#### B. Territory & Concentration Risk
- North America contributes ~50% of reseller revenues; Europe volatility magnified enterprise risk. 
- Action: run Cost-to-Serve × Market Potential model per territory; rebalance investments and margin guardrails.

#### C. Data & Audit Trail
- Incomplete freight/discount records in early-year tables hinder forensic analysis.  
- Action: certify datasets in Fabric (lineage + QA pipelines) and link every Power BI measure to the underlying table + DAX logic.

### 📊 Reseller Diagnostic Matrix (high-signal)
| KPI | Trend | Priority | Immediate Control |
|---|---:|:--:|---|
| Unit Price (AUP) | ↓ 7–15% (2010–2012) | 🔴 Critical | Price approval workflow + AUP monitoring |
| Discounts | ↑ after AUP drop | 🟡 Watch | Discount caps, approval logs |
| Volume | Stable | 🟡 Watch | Value-selling vs. price-selling programs |
| Product Cost | Flat | 🟢 Stable | Maintain procurement discipline |
| Regional Concentration | NA ≈ 50% | 🔴 Critical | Diversify revenue sources |

---

## PART B — INTERNET SALES (Channel: D2C / eCommerce)

### 🌟 Highlights — Growth Signals (Internet)
| 🟢 Area | Evidence | Why it matters |
|---:|:---|:---|
| Transaction growth | Total transactions rose strongly FY2010→2013 (+55–65%). | Demonstrates customer acquisition capability & platform reach. 
| Top-line expansion | Total Internet Sales increased ~40–50% (2010→2013). | Rapid top-line scale — attractive to growth investors. 

---

### ⚠️ Lowlights — Structural & Governance Risks (Internet)
| 🔴 Risk | Data signal | Business implication |
|---:|:---|:---|
| Volume-led, margin-dilutive growth | Avg Sales/txn ↓ 15–25% while transactions rose. | Growth at the cost of yield; structurally dilutes profitability. 
| Immediate AUP reductions after cost drops | Unit prices dropped systemically in step with falling product cost. | Failure to convert cost savings to margin improvement — missed margin expansion opportunity. 
| Regional price sensitivity | Europe/APAC saw larger AUP declines than NA. | Requires localized price governance and elasticity modeling.

---

### 🧠 Deep-Dive — Internet Risk Zones
#### A. Strategic Choice vs Execution Failure
- Observed pattern: management pursued **penetration** (lower AUP + higher promo) to buy market share; this was executed via system-level price reductions rather than controlled, segmented discounting. That produced growth but not profitable scale. 

#### B. Product Mix & “Barbell” Pattern
- Premium SKUs largely retained pricing; mid-tier SKUs were discounted heavily. Result: expansion in customer base but lower average order value (AOV). 

#### C. Governance Failure — Pricing Discipline
- Pricing changes lacked elasticity analysis, territory granularity, and board-level sign-off. That strategic omission made Internet Sales a “growth trap.”

**Immediate war-room actions for Internet:**
1. Freeze any global list-price changes pending elasticity review.
2. Introduce a Product-Pricing Matrix: LVP/Target Margin/Pricing Band per SKU tier.
3. Create a short-term yield program: targeted bundling & premiumization pilots.

### 📊 Internet Diagnostic Matrix (high-signal)
| KPI | Trend | Priority | Immediate Control |
|---|---:|:--:|---|
| Transactions | ↑ 55–65% | 🟢 Growth | Maintain platform scale efficiency |
| Avg Sales/Txn (AOV) | ↓ 15–25% | 🔴 Critical | Price re-segmentation & bundling pilots |
| Discount Ratio | ↑ ~4 pts (2010→2013) | 🟡 Watch | Discount guardrails & spend ROI test |
| Regional Elasticity | Europe/APAC > NA | 🟡 Watch | Localized price governance |

## PART C — INTEGRATED VIEW: Enterprise Sales Health (Reseller + Internet)

### 🔗 Cross-Channel Synthesis (What matters for investors & regulators)
- **Root cause of enterprise margin stress**: Systemic unit-price reductions (AUP re-benchmarks) applied across channels, not tactical discounts alone. This is visible in both Reseller and Internet tables — Reseller margins collapsed after AUP drops; Internet Sales grew volumes but at lower yield. 
- **Discounts were secondary**: discounting rose after AUP change in Reseller; in Internet, discounts and price reductions co-existed as part of a penetration strategy. Both channels reveal governance omissions — lack of approved price strategy and missing elasticity analysis. 
- **Opportunity vector**: Because product costs remained stable/declined modestly, restoring pricing discipline could *recover margin* rapidly without immediate revenue loss.

---

## 🔧 Enterprise Priorities (Board/Investor War-Room)
1. **Price Governance (Top Priority — immediate)**  
   - Enforce approval workflow for all list-price resets.  
   - Deploy the AUP Index & require pre-change elasticity simulation for any >2% system-wide move.

2. **Margin Recovery Program (30–90 days)**  
   - Select 3 pilot markets + 5 SKUs for premiumization & bundling to prove yield recovery.  
   - Recalibrate discount policy: caps, stacking rules, and ROI gating.

3. **Data & Lineage Remediation**  
   - Certify Fabric datasets; fix missing discount/freight logging. Commit to daily QA runs and dataset certification badges.

4. **Territory De-risk & Diversify**  
   - Rebalance investments away from single-territory dependence; target Pacific expansion where cost-to-serve looks favorable.

5. **Regulator & Investor Communication**  
   - Publish a one-page transparency note explaining historical pricing choices, remediation actions, and expected short-term margin trajectories.

## 📈 Quick Tactical Roadmap (90 days)
- Week 0–2: Freeze global price changes; enable approval gates.  
- Week 1–4: Launch AUP Index dashboard + margin variance card in Power BI (Fabric lineage linked).  
- Week 3–8: Run elasticity experiments (A/B price tests) in Internet channel and targeted reseller cohorts.  
- Week 6–12: Rollout pilot premiumization bundles; measure AOV uplift and net margin impact.  
- Week 8–12: Produce investor/regulator brief and publish certified KPI package.
